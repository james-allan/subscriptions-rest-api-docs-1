# Authentication #

WooCommerce includes two ways to authenticate with the WP REST API. It is also possible to authenticate using any [WP REST API authentication](http://v3.wp-api.org/guide/authentication/) plugin or method.

Please refer to WooCommerce's guide on [generating REST API keys and authentication](https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#authentication).
